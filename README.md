# Stock-Analysis
Uoft Data Bootcamp Challenge Assignment #2. 
Analyzed stock market data using microsoft excel's Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). 
This project analyzes the stock market trends between the years of 2018-2020 using scripted loops, creating new columns, formatting percentage calculations, and using conditional formatting to highlight percentage changes of stock market prices between the openning and closing of the year.
Additionally, I used a smaller file titled "alphabetical testing.xlsx" to run the code faster on a smaller dataset.
